His practice engages performative systems and institutional grammars, examining how symbolic structures operate across opacity and aesthetic legibility. He often attends to moments designed to pass unnoticed. Kalra holds a graduate degree from the Royal College of Art and teaches in the MFA Communications Design program at Pratt Institute.</p>
